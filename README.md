# IFramR
IFramR is an place with (maybe) many iframes to use in school or wherever!
# Development
Development may take a ton of time because there are many things I am planning to do with this project. Progress is shared below.
# About
## (The About section is also on IFramR. Please only read this if it seems sketchy.)

IFramR is almost a proxy but also isn't. It will have iframes such as Google and a bunch of other games. IFramR will have better styling than my other projects and I have a lot of time to develop.
# Progress
## As with my other projects, I am putting progress here in order.

🟩 Start all essential HTML and CSS code.

🟩 Complete all necessary HTML and CSS code.

🟩 Link the About section to the IFramR page for easy access.

🟩 Start writing the About section in HTML code.

🟨 Start the actual iframe part!
